Projects 
3-dimensional game engine JavaScript

e-commerce platform

Server session limits
-have not implemented but am curious about implementing a software system purely based on sessions per server
-a single master database to connect with each servers assigned database

AI 
-as my perspective suggests

-understand the unique point (per feature) on a graph is all that is needed to begin building a linear regression model from scratch (examples in code)

-understand that comparison methods can be used on lines to label targets/categories, and make data driven decisions ie. Regression min formulas, pattern matching formulas, line statistic formulas over line periods. 

-created a LLM using the unique path of a sentence fit into an object

-understand large data feeding strategies using sound, and text and question answer input requests

-created a picture model to most accurately label pictures 
 parameters: pixel_density on a black to white scale, pixel_location denoted by increase in x, as pixels 

-created a question model to most accurately answer questions
 parameters: letter, letter_location

-created a video model to accurately label a set of frames 
parameters: pixel density on a black to white scale, pixel_location denoted by increase in x, as pixels 
-purpose is to define each frame as a line, and connect many frames (lines) - and run a total regression 
min formula, and apply that to incoming targets. However other statistical methods as well applied to accurately label uniqueness of target.

-capable of integrating video game models using player frame input denoted with a unique line
understand that the appended to line of each particular frame, can be drawn together, to make in game winning and losing decisions

-created two models to compare where a flock of birds moved per sound input
 parameters: overall_bird_location
 parameters: overall_bird_sound
